# accphys

This repository is for my PhD research in accelerator physics. The structure is:

**./pyorbit-studies**	- studies using my fork of (py-orbit)[https://github.com/austin-hoover/py-orbit]

**./tools** - data analysis and visualization modules 

**./jupter_notebooks** - miscellaneous studies using Jupyter notebooks

Some of the routines may be able to be written in a nicer or more efficient way, so any suggestions are welcome.
